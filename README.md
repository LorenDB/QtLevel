# QtLevel

A level app written in Qt. Don't expect anything else out of it, and maybe you will be pleasantly surprised.

## Features

- Material theme
  - Customizable primary and accent colors
  - Customizable light, dark, or system scheme (warning: system doesn't work for me)
- Customizable decimal precision for degrees of tilt
- A center target that changes color when the bubble is centered
- Fixed portrait orientation with auto-rotate of some elements to prevent breaking the app's display

## Installation

1. Install Qt for Android or Qt for iOS (warning: iOS is untested, but should work fine).
2. Build app.
3. Deploy to your phone.
4. Enjoy!
